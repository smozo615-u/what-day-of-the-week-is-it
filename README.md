# Date Calculator for the 20th and 21st Centuries

## Description

This repository contains a Python project developed to calculate the day of the week for any date in the 20th and 21st centuries. The algorithm is based on the method explained in the document _El calendario Occidental_, which uses modular arithmetic and century corrections to determine weekdays.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md:** This file.
- **main.py:** The main Python source code.

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements

- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

### Running in Interactive Mode

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input day, month, and year.

### Running Tests

At startup, type `t` when prompted to run the test suite, which verifies the algorithm with several sample dates.

## Example Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted:

```bash
Type 't' to run tests, or any other key to use interactive mode:
```
